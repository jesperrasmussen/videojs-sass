# Sassy Video.js

The Video.js stylesheet, converted into cleaner Sass. Obviously full credit goes to [Video.js](https://github.com/videojs).

Differences

*  IE9 & up (unnecessary prefixes removed)
*  Less overwriting (I removed most instances of `.vjs-default-skin` so things are accessible via one class instead of the original two)
*  No procedural comments (I removed most comments related to fixes and practice, and kept only section headings)
